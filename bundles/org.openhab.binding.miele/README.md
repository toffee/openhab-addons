# Miele@home Binding

This binding integrates Miele@home appliances.
Miele@home allows controlling Miele appliances that are equipped with special communication modules. 
There are devices that communicate through ZigBee and others that use WiFi.

See [www.miele.de](https://www.miele.de) for the list of available appliances.

## Supported Things

This binding requires the XGW3000 gateway from Miele as all integration with openHAB is done through this gateway.
While users with ZigBee-enabled Miele appliances usually own such a gateway, this is often not the case for people that have only WiFi-enabled appliances.

The types of appliances that are supported by this binding are: 

- Coffeemachine
- Dishwasher
- Fridge
- Fridge/Freezer combination
- Hob
- Hood
- Oven
- Microwave/Oven combination
- Tumbledryer
- Washingmachine

## Discovery

The binding is able to auto-discover the Miele XGW3000 gateway.
When an XGW3000 gateway is discovered, all appliances can be subsequently discovered.


## Thing Configuration

Each appliances needs the device UID as a configuration parameter.
The UID is nowhere to be found on the appliances, but since the discovery works quite reliably, a manual configuration is not needed.

Once you got hold of the IDs, a manual configuration looks like this:

```
Bridge miele:xgw3000:dilbeek [ipAddress="192.168.0.18", interface="192.168.0.5"] {
